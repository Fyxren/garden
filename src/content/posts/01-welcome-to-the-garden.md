## Introduction
Greetings, and welcome to my garden! This will be my place to share thoughs, stories and maybe some surprises in this green, not-so-green space. The topics may vary, a lot, depending on whatever I find interesting & worth writing about.

## Why a garden?
You might be curious about why I'm calling it a garden. Well, think of a garden like a big family of plants, each one unique and special. Just as every flower adds its own touch, my 'garden' here is filled with different stories, thoughts, and surprises â€” each one bringing its own bit of color and charm. 

Or at least, I hope it will be, at some point. But you know, everyone has to start somewhere. I'm definitely no difference.

## Credits
I used MaeWollf's template for this blog, which you can check out [here]. I do plan on creating one myself eventually, but that may take a _long_ while.

Well, that's all I have for now. Happy new year & have a good one! ðŸ’™
